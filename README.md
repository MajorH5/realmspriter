## About RealmSpriter

**RealmSpriter** is a fully functional recreation of RotMG sprite editor with color picker, sprite outling, shadows, animations, & more. Supports common realm sprite sizes like 8x8, 16x8, 16x16, and 32x32 with easy extensibility for more sizes, or even non-preset sizes. Includes a working undo system, offline mode, and browsable database of Realm of the Mad God sprite data up until 2020.

This project aims to not only recreate the original editor, but also expand upon it with more features. Beyond the existing features in the original, RealmSpriter has implemented post comments, likes/dislikes, reporting, and notifications, in addition to a long overdue export button.

Note that this repository contains the client-side codebase for the RealmSpriter platform. In order to make use of backend features (accounts, public posting, etc.), you must implement a functional backend according to client-side API calls which are fairly straightforward.
